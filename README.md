# PhotoSculpt-Textures
Here is the Open source version of my software PhotoSculpt Textures v2.04

# What is it?
* PhotoSculpt Textures is a specialized software tool used to create high-resolution 3D textures and models from just two photographs of a subject taken from different angles. 
* This software caters specifically to computer graphics artists by enabling them to generate fully textured 3D models and tileable textures for further use in various 3D applications.

# Reviews 
* "[...] given we have a very extensive knowledge of all the texturing solutions out there, I can say with certainty that you already have a market-leading solution.  [...] really impressed so far and wish you all the best."'' Dave O. editor at CGenie.com, UK
  * https://web.archive.org/web/20180527195505/http://photosculpt.net/buy-now
* "Very functional, and can definitely save a lot of time. If you where comfortable with, or not good at, texture creation in photoshop or mudbox/zbrush. Then this would be an invaluable piece of software, as it basically removes that whole element of the design process."'' Graeme Palmer, freelance 3d modeller, Scotland
